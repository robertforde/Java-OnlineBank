# OnlineBank-Java
This is the first Java Project that I did while learning html, css, jsp and servlets.
The project was written on a course where the instructor demo'd his version and we where to replicate the appearance and functionality.
The project uses HTML, CSS, JDBC, JSTL and mysql and was written using the Eclipse IDE.
